model: opus
description: Turns a designed situation or current campaign state into a table-ready D&D session — a clear session goal, secrets/clues/leads, active timers, encounters that are situations (not just fights), meaningful decisions with visible stakes, spotlight moments, a variety/pacing plan, delegation, and narration prep. Use whenever the user wants to prep, plan, or get ready to *run* a session — "prep my next session," "what should happen at the table," "I'm running D&D tomorrow," "turn this into a session," "I don't know what to prep" — especially after an adventure has been designed. Engagement-and-execution focused (Angry GM + DM David); pairs with dnd-adventure-design (structure) upstream.

# dnd-session-prep

Turn a settled direction — a designed situation, a campaign in motion, or "we left off here" — into material you can actually run *next session*. Where `dnd-adventure-design` builds the situation's architecture (nodes, clues, factions), this skill makes that architecture playable at the table: what the players will care about, what they can do, how the world pushes back, and how to keep it moving.

Two schools drive this skill. **The Angry GM** — make players *care*: investment, stakes, consequences, meaningful decisions, clear narration (full reference in `references/angry-gm-principles.md`). **DM David** — run it *smoothly*: prepare secrets/clues/leads not scenes, prep only what's needed, delegate, keep momentum, manage spotlight and pacing (full reference in `references/dm-david-principles.md`). Read whichever you need the reasoning from; the workflow below is enough to run.

## The two questions that govern prep

- **Prepare what you'll actually use.** Players only ever experience what reaches the table, and the DM is usually the slowest part of it. Prep the *likely* next content — the situations, NPCs, and locations they'll probably hit — not six sessions of contingency. The best input here is what the players said they'd do at the end of last session; if you don't have it, infer the two or three most probable directions and prep those.
- **Prepare situations, not encounters.** A situation survives player choice; a scripted encounter shatters the moment they negotiate, sneak, or invent something. Frame every prepped beat as a situation with goals and pressures the players can engage any way they like — not a fixed event that must play out.

## Workflow

1. **Anchor in where things stand.** Load context in this order — budget matters:

   **Budget rule:** Tier 1 files are mandatory even if they exceed 5K tokens — load them all, then skip Tier 2 unless explicitly needed. If Tier 1 exceeds 5K, note `[TIER 1 OVERRUN: {n}K tokens — Tier 2 skipped unless user requests it]` in Context Flags.

   **Tier 1 — always read (< 5K tokens target):**
   - Campaign Dashboard (`{Campaign Name} - Campaign Dashboard.md` for CotU campaigns; fallback `CAMPAIGN_MAP.md`) — points to all live resources
   - Last 1–2 session notes — what actually happened at the table
   - `OPEN_THREADS.md` — top active threads

   **Tier 2 — filtered reads (read only the relevant slice, not the full file):**
   - `Decision Log.md` — settled decisions only. **Filter strategy (in order):**
     1. If Decision Log uses status markers, grep for `LOCKED` or `status: locked` — load matching entries
     2. If no status markers (e.g. Decision Log uses numbered `### DECISION N` headers), grep for NPC/location/faction names from active threads + OPEN_THREADS — load matching entries plus most recent 10–15 entries
     3. Fallback: load last ~500 lines of the file (most recent decisions)
     Always load before anything else in Tier 2 — this is the primary guard against re-litigating settled decisions.
   - **Narrative arc summary** — in order of preference: (a) `Story So Far.md` most recent arc chapter if the file exists; (b) if it doesn’t, read the Front Movement tables from the last 2–3 session notes (shows what’s moved recently); (c) Campaign Dashboard “Current Focus” or “Active Arc” section as minimal orientation. If none exist and campaign is >20 sessions, flag it in the prep output.
   - `Storylines & Fronts/` — **active fronts only.** Detection in order: (1) skip files with `(TBD)` in filename; (2) for remaining files check frontmatter `status:` field — load `active`/`in-progress`, skip `dormant`/`tbd`/`parked`; (3) fallback: load any front that appears in the last 2–3 sessions’ Front Movement table. For each active front: what’s their next scheduled beat, what are they doing right now independent of the party?
   - `PLAYER_KNOWLEDGE.md` (if it exists — created/updated by `dnd-player-knowledge-sync` after each session) — what the players actually know vs. what exists only in GM notes
   - Relevant `NPCs/`, `Factions/`, `Locations/` files for the threads you're actively prepping

   **Tier 3 — deep context (continuity checks, NPC web work, councils — not standard session prep):**
   - Full Decision Log, full session archive, graphify output

   **Locked Constraints (mandatory, output to prep doc):** After loading Tier 2, extract all LOCKED Decision Log entries relevant to the current arc and write them into the prep doc under `## Locked Constraints`. Then proceed through Steps 2–7 to generate session content. After completing Step 7 (before Step 8), do a single pass: review all generated content against the Locked Constraints list. If any conflict found, flag each one and pause before Step 8. Do not proceed until the GM confirms either: (a) the decision has changed (update Decision Log first), or (b) there is no actual contradiction. A single post-generation gate is cleaner than stopping after each step.

   **(Echos campaigns only)** If `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` exists, load session-blocking items only — entries marked or escalated as “session-blocking” or “S{current+1}-blocker”. List under `## Context Flags` in prep output. Skip file if no such entries exist.

   **Cold start (no prior campaign files):** If none of the Tier 1 files exist, ask: “Is this Session 1?” If yes: ask for the opening situation or PC starting state and use that as sole context; skip session notes and OPEN_THREADS. If no: ask user to provide at least one of: prior session note, Campaign Dashboard, or campaign state summary before proceeding.

   Capture two things explicitly: **what changed last session**, and **what the players said they'd do next.** If a designed situation exists (from `dnd-adventure-design`), start from it. Don't re-read the whole archive.

2. **Set one clear session goal.** Players need to know what they're trying to accomplish, and so do you. Make it achievable, understandable, and measurable — "stop the ritual before the full moon," not "deal with the cult somehow." This anchors pacing: when play drifts, the goal tells you what to reassert.

3. **Name the investment, and put it in the room.** State why *this* party cares right now — the emotional anchor (an NPC they love, a place they've bled for, a personal stake). Make the anchor *present and active* this session, not a quest-giver behind a desk: let the party see the frightened person, the empty cot, the threatened place, early. If the upcoming material has none, build one in — a named, vulnerable person tied to this session's problem and on the same clock beats any lore. Note one personal thread per PC so the investment isn't carried by a single character. Investment is the difference between players making choices and players spectating.

4. **Lay out secrets, clues, and leads.** List the **secrets** (truths in the world relevant this session), the **clues** that let players uncover each (with the Three Clue Rule in mind — no single point of failure), and the **leads** that point them onward so they’re never stranded without a next move. Players assemble the sequence; you supply the information. Mind the line between **public belief** and **GM truth**: check `PLAYER_KNOWLEDGE.md` (if it exists — maintained by `dnd-player-knowledge-sync`) so a clue advances them rather than restating what they already have — or accidentally handing over a secret they haven’t earned.

   **Reading PLAYER_KNOWLEDGE.md:** Expect five sections per session block: *NPCs Encountered* table (NPC as known | GM file | what they know | what they don’t | relationship | session), *Locations Visited* table, *Information Learned (Confirmed)* table (fact | source | session), *Rumors & Unverified Leads* table, *Secrets Revealed* list. To check if a clue is redundant: search Information Learned for the fact; if found, redesign the clue to advance to the next layer of information (not just re-state what’s known). If file shows `[BOOTSTRAPPED at S{n}]`, knowledge before that session may be incomplete — do NOT search the archive (violates Tier 1 budget); instead, note the gap under Context Flags and infer from the loaded Tier 1 sessions only. If a missing fact becomes session-blocking, add to OPEN_THREADS for targeted load next prep cycle.

   If `PLAYER_KNOWLEDGE.md` doesn’t exist yet, infer from session notes what the players have seen and heard.

5. **Advance the clocks.** Note every **active timer** moving this session — villain plans, faction maneuvers, rituals, political events — and where each stands. The world changes whether or not the players act; surface that pressure so their choices carry weight and urgency.

6. **Build encounters as decisions with visible stakes.** Remember an "encounter" is *any* meaningful situation needing a decision — negotiation, chase, investigation, trap, social conflict, or combat — not just a fight. For each, give it the three things a real decision needs: **information** (players can see enough to choose on purpose), **stakes** (state what success, failure, and cost each mean), and **tradeoffs** (every option gives something up). Keep risks *visible* up front — known danger creates tension; hidden "gotcha" lethality breaks trust. Never present a threat the party can't defeat, outwit, or avoid.

7. **Plan spotlight and variety.** Earmark at least one moment per player where their abilities, backstory, or choices matter — don't leave the spotlight to chance. Then check the mix: vary combat, investigation, exploration, and social beats so the session doesn't run as one repeated note.

8. **Plan pacing and momentum.** Predict where players might stall (a stuck investigation, an unclear goal, analysis paralysis) and prep the lever that restores motion: new information, a new threat, a ticking clock, a consequence. Momentum dies in uncertainty; clarity and a fresh choice restore it.

9. **Offload table logistics.** You don't have to run everything. Decide what to delegate — initiative tracking, condition/HP tracking, the session journal, map/mini setup — so you stay focused on situations and narration instead of bookkeeping.

10. **Prep narration for the key scenes.** For the two or three beats that matter most, prep *actionable* description, not mood-poetry: what exists, what matters, and what players can interact with ("three stone altars, one slick with fresh blood" — not "an old, mysterious room"). Visualize the space first so positions and objects stay consistent. At the table, run resolution as **Declare → Determine → Describe**: the player states an action, you resolve it, you narrate the result — clean and in order.

11. **Close the loop.** End the prep with the **consequences** that are queued: how the world will visibly shift depending on what the players do. For a final pre-table safety check, route to `dnd-review` (agency + continuity). After the session runs, close it with `dnd-session-recap-loop` — that workflow includes the player knowledge boundary update (`dnd-player-knowledge-sync`) and faction clock advance.

## Output rules

Prep for *use*, not for show — favor what the players will probably touch over exhaustive coverage, and favor momentum over simulation detail. Keep every beat a situation that survives unexpected player choices; if you've written a fixed sequence of events, you've written a script, so turn it back into a situation with goals and pressures. Make stakes and risks explicit and visible. Protect player trust: consistent rulings, logical consequences, honest NPCs, no information hidden just to spring a "gotcha." Cite canon file paths when you lean on them, and never update campaign docs until the DM confirms outcomes.
